        I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to apply for the 
        {position} role at {company}, as advertised on LinkedIn.

        I am a skilled web developer with experience in Python and Django. I developed a 
        social media website that enables users to connect, share, and interact seamlessly. 
        This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python, Django, SQLite3, and front-end technologies like 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My work on this project earned me the runner-up prize in a social networking 
        site design competition.

        I attached my resume and portfolio attached for your review. I would welcome the opportunity 
        to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

        Best regards,
